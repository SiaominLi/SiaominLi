# Hello! It's Siaomin!

I am a student in NCHU with a focus on **Natural Language Processing** and **Image Recognition**, gaining experience in logic scheduling design and electronic circuits.
In my future graduate studies, I aim to focus on **digital IC design** with a keen interest in accelerating the computational efficiency of deep learning models.
I am interested in exploring applications of AI and constantly expanding my knowledge in this field.
